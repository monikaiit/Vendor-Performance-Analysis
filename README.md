# Vendor Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **real-world, business-driven data analytics case study** focused on evaluating vendor and brand performance using large-scale procurement and sales data.  
The objective is to generate **actionable insights** that support data-driven procurement, inventory optimization, and profitability decisions.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Organizations often face challenges in:
- Identifying vendors that genuinely drive profitability  
- Detecting underperforming vendors causing profit leakage  
- Managing unsold inventory and inefficient procurement  

This project addresses these challenges using a structured analytics workflow.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, joins, aggregations, vendor-level summaries  
- **Python** – Data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, KPI computation  

---

## 🔍 Analytical Approach
- Integrated multiple procurement and sales datasets to create a unified vendor-level dataset  
- Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure consistency and analytical accuracy  
- Engineered key performance metrics such as total sales, purchase value, gross profit, profit margin, and unsold capital  
- Analyzed vendor and brand performance to uncover efficiency gaps and profitability trends  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- A small set of vendors contributes a disproportionately high share of total sales and profit  
- Several vendors show high purchase volumes but low profit margins, indicating inefficiencies  
- Unsold capital highlights inventory risks associated with specific vendors and brands  
- Vendor-level performance comparison enables data-driven procurement optimization
