# Vendor Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **real-world, business-driven data analytics case study** aimed at evaluating vendor and brand performance using large-scale procurement and sales data.  
The goal is to convert raw transactional data into **actionable insights** that support smarter procurement, inventory management, and profitability decisions.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Organizations often struggle to identify:
- Which vendors truly drive profitability  
- Where capital is getting blocked due to poor vendor performance  
- Which brands and vendors require optimization or replacement  

This project addresses these challenges using a structured analytics approach.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, joins, aggregations, vendor-level summaries  
- **Python** – Data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, KPI computation  
- **Power BI** – Visualization and business reporting  

---

## 🔍 Analytical Approach
- Combined multiple procurement and sales datasets to create a unified vendor-level view  
- Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy  
- Engineered key performance metrics such as total sales, purchase value, gross profit, profit margin, and unsold capital  
- Analyzed vendor and brand performance to identify efficiency gaps and profitability trends  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Clear performance gap observed between top-performing and underperforming vendors  
- A small group of vendors contributes disproportionately to total sales and profit  
- Certain vendors exhibit high purchase volume but low profitability, indicating inefficiencies  
- Unsold capital highlights inventory and procurement risks linked to vendor selection
